           <p>A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Angiospermae). <br>The biological function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs.<br> Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) resulting from cross-pollination or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower) when self-pollination occurs.</p>
